# renewable_energy_prediction-wind_turbine-_power_generation

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the power generated by a wind turbine at each time interval based on historical data. The goal is to analyze the contributing factors that affect power generation, with a particular focus on understanding the patterns of wind in each month. Using an **XGBoost Regressor** model, we aim to identify the primary factors affecting energy production, especially wind speed, and predict future power generation patterns.

## Problem Definition

Given past data from a wind turbine, we need to:
- **Predict the power generated by the wind turbine** based on past data and environmental conditions.
- **Identify the key factors** that affect power generation.
- **Analyze the wind speed patterns** for each month to improve forecasting accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following key features:

- **ActivePower**: Power generated by the turbine (target variable)
- **AmbientTemperature**: Ambient temperature at the turbine location
- **BearingShaftTemperature**: Temperature of the bearing shaft
- **Blade1PitchAngle, Blade2PitchAngle, Blade3PitchAngle**: Pitch angles of the turbine blades
- **ControlBoxTemperature**: Temperature of the control box
- **GearboxBearingTemperature**: Temperature of the gearbox bearings
- **GeneratorRPM**: Revolutions per minute of the generator
- **WindDirection**: Direction of the wind
- **WindSpeed**: Speed of the wind (primary factor in power generation)

### Feature Analysis:
Through data analysis, we determined that **Wind Speed** is the most significant contributing factor to **ActivePower** generation. 

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
   - Normalize and scale numerical features to prepare for modeling.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract temporal features (e.g., month, day of week) to capture time-related patterns.
   - Investigate correlations between features such as wind speed, temperature, and turbine performance.

3. **Modeling**:
   - **XGBoost Regressor**: A gradient boosting model used for time series regression tasks. This model is chosen due to its ability to handle complex relationships and provide high performance on tabular data.
   - The target variable is **ActivePower**, and the model uses features like **WindSpeed**, **AmbientTemperature**, **GearboxOilTemperature**, and others to predict the active power generation.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics:
     - **Coefficient of Determination (R²)** = 0.045
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** = 438.22
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** = 518.63
     - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** = 3.975%

5. **Wind Pattern Prediction**:
   - The model is also used to predict monthly wind patterns based on past wind speed data, which can help optimize future turbine operation and maintenance.

## Results

The model was evaluated based on several common regression evaluation metrics:

- **Coefficient of Determination (R²)**: 0.045 – indicates that the model explains about 4.5% of the variance in power generation.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 438.22 – indicates an average error of 438.22 watts in the power prediction.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 518.63 – indicates the average magnitude of the error.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: 3.975% – indicates the model's prediction error is around 3.98% on average.

Although the R² value is relatively low, the model performs reasonably well for predicting power generation. The model can be further optimized by refining the feature set or incorporating additional environmental data.
